      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am learning how to be a programmer. This is my first project using HTML and CSS. I want to pursue a career in software engineering. I've decided to go down the self-taught path. My friend, Philip, is my mentor because he is the one who recommended me the online course that I am taking now. </p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code because I want to make a career change. I've been working in Physical Therapy, but I don't think that it's for me. It's time for a new change and I've always loved working with computers. At work, I'm basically
          the IT guy and everyone asks me for help when any kind of technology/software is involved.</p>

        <h3>PC Building</h3>
        <p>I originally built my first PC in 2017 after I graduated college. It's my personal computer for gaming and light content creation. Over the years, I've upgraded components and replaced almost everything. Since I enjoy it as a hobby so
          much, I thought I would try and turn it into a career.</p>

        <h3>Sim Racing</h3>
        <p>I've recently picked up sim racing. Currently, my favorite game is Assetto Corsa. It's Italian for "Race Setup". The game was released in 2014, but thanks to its support for extensive customization and moddability, the graphics have been updated to look just as good as some of the newer sim racing titles. My favorite car to drive is the Formula 1 Hybrid 2022 car made by Race Sim Studios. To really make the experience even better, I like to jump into the car in Virtual Reality. The immersion you get from sitting inside the car is unbeatable. The added depth perception makes it easier to hit the apex when cornering because you can see how far away you are from the inside line.</p>
